FRONT-END ASSIGNMENT ROUND
Problem Statement
Create a Customizable Finance Dashboard where users can build their
own real-time finance monitoring dashboard by connecting to various
financial APIs and displaying real-time data through customizable
widgets.
Objectives
1. Develop a user-friendly finance dashboard builder that
supports real-time data visualization.
2. Enable seamless integration with multiple financial APIs
(stocks).
3. Provide intuitive widget management with drag-and-drop
functionality.
4. Implement robust state management and data persistence
capabilities.
Technologies
• Frontend Framework:Next.js
• Styling: CSS, Tailwind CSS, Styled-Components
• State Management: Redux/Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai
• Data Visualization: Chart.js, Recharts, or similar charting
libraries
• Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
Features
1. Widget Management System:
○ Add Widgets: Users can create new finance data widgets by
connecting to any financial API-
● Table: A paginated list or grid of stocks with filters
and search functionality.
● Finance Cards: A list or single card view for:
○ Watchlist
○ Market Gainers
○ Performance Data
○ Financial Data
● Charts: Candle or Line graphs showing stock prices over
different intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
○ Remove Widgets: Easy deletion of unwanted widgets from the
dashboard
○ Rearrange Layout: Drag-and-drop functionality to reorganize
widget positions on the dashboard
○ Widget Configuration: Each widget includes a configuration panel
for customization
2. API Integration & Data Handling:
○ Dynamic Data Mapping: Users can explore API responses and select
specific fields to display
○ Real-time Updates: Automatic data refresh with configurable
intervals
○ Data Caching: Intelligent caching system to optimize API calls
and reduce redundant requests
3. User Interface & Experience:
○ Customizable Widgets: Each widget displays as a finance card with
editable titles and selected metrics
○ Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout supporting multiple
screen sizes
○ Loading & Error States: Comprehensive handling of loading, error,
and empty data states
4. Data Persistence:
○ Browser Storage Integration: All widget configurations and
dashboard layouts persist across sessions
○ State Recovery: Complete dashboard restoration upon page refresh
or browser restart
○ Configuration Backup: Export/import functionality for dashboard
configurations
5. Advanced Widget Features:
○ Field Selection Interface: Interactive JSON explorer for choosing
display fields
○ Custom Formatting: Support for different data formats (currency,
percentage, etc.)
○ Widget Naming: User-defined widget titles and descriptions
○ API Endpoint Management: Easy switching between different API
endpoints per widget
API Integration Guidelines
• Use reliable financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, IndianAPI
etc.)
• You'll need an API key to access the endpoints. Generate an API
key for the app and check the limits on requests per minute and
requests per day.
• Implement proper API key management and security practices
• Handle rate limiting and API quota management gracefully
Technical Requirements
• Follow a well-defined, scalable folder structure
• Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
• Optimize for performance with lazy loading, code splitting,
rendering strategies (CSR/SSR)
Brownie Points
Note: Focus on core functionality first. Once basic features are
working, explore these advanced features:
1. Dynamic Theme Switching: Implement a dynamic theme-switching
feature that allows users to toggle between Light and Dark
modes seamlessly.
2. Real-time data: Implement sockets for live data updates over
widget.
3. Dashboard Templates: Pre-built dashboard templates for
Evaluation Criteria
This assignment evaluates:
• Frontend Development Skills: React proficiency, component
architecture, and modern JavaScript
• State Management: Effective use of Redux/Zustand for complex
application state
• API Integration: Handling dynamic JSON data and implementing
robust data fetching strategies
• User Experience Design: Creating intuitive interfaces that
non-technical users can navigate easily
• Problem-Solving Ability: Implementing flexible solutions for
diverse API structures and data formats
• Code Quality: Clean, maintainable, and scalable code architecture
FAQ
API and Data Handling
Q: How do I handle different API response formats?
A: Implement a flexible data mapper that can handle various JSON
structures. Consider creating adapters for common API formats.
Q: What happens if the API request limit is reached?
A: If the API request limit is reached, the website may temporarily
stop fetching new data until the limit resets. You may see a message
indicating that the API limit has been reached and suggesting you
try again later.
Q: How do I create a new API key?
A: To create a new API key, follow these steps :
1. Visit the API provider's website (e.g., Alpha Vantage).
2. Sign in to your account or create a new account if you don't
have one.
3. Navigate to the API section or dashboard.
4. Look for an option to generate a new API key.
5. Follow the prompts to create and copy the new API key.
6. Update your web application's configuration with the new API
key.
Q: What are common API errors and what should I do when API rate
limits are exceeded?
A:.Common API errors include exceeding the rate limit, invalid API
keys, CORS and network issues. To avoid rate limit cache API
responses. Also, each API provider has specific rate limits, which
are typically documented on their website.
Q: What should I do when API rate limits are exceeded?
A: For support or feedback, you can contact the team through the
provided contact information in the email.
All the best !!
